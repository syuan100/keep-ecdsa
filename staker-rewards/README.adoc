To run the script, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

  the https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm[Node Version Manager] to get the right
  Node.js version with no troubles. You can install this tool by running
  `brew install nvm` on macOS or follow the https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating[installation guide]
  for other operating systems.

2. Install the NPM dependencies if not done yet:
+

3. Run the script along with environment variables:
